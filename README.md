DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK PERFORMED --- 
This project focuses on predicting the compressive strength of concrete using machine learning techniques, aiming to provide accurate and interpretable insights into how different mix components affect strength. The dataset included variables such as cement, water, slag, fly ash, superplasticizer, coarse and fine aggregates, and age. Initial steps involved thorough preprocessing, normalization, and exploratory data analysis using correlation heatmaps, scatter plots, and distribution visualizations. Several regression models were trained, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and a Neural Network. Among these, ensemble models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting performed best due to their ability to capture nonlinear relationships.

Model evaluation was done using metrics like R squared error and Mean Squared Error. To enhance interpretability, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values were employed, offering a clear understanding of how each feature impacted the model's predictions. SHAP summary plots revealed that higher cement content positively influenced strength, while higher water content generally had a negative impact. Partial Dependence Plots were explored to visualize feature effects, but compatibility issues led to the use of alternatives like Permutation Importance for ranking features based on their effect on model performance.

Feature selection was further refined using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), which iteratively removed less significant features to identify the most influential ones. This not only simplified the model but also ensured minimal loss in performance. The final model was both accurate and explainable, making it practical for real-world use in predicting concrete quality.

The project also explored enhancements like hyperparameter tuning through grid search and visual interfaces using Streamlit for interactive prediction. Despite minor technical challenges, the overall outcome was a robust and interpretable machine learning system that can support civil engineers in designing more effective concrete mixes. This project demonstrates the strong synergy between data science and civil engineering, emphasizing both predictive power and transparency in results.
